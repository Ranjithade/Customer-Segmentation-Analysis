Imagine pitching premium products to a customer who shops economically or offering bundled products to someone who prefers a single yet priced product. Will this convert?

Probably not. None of the policies checks out the one-size-fits-all criterion, as customers have unique needs and expectations. This is where customer segmentation analysis can save a lot of time and ensure maximum results.

A customer segmentation project aims for data analysts to identify different groups of customers with similar needs and behaviors so that companies can tailor their marketing, product development, and customer service strategies to meet their needs better. This can be done by clubbing them as per: marital status, new customers, repeat customers, etc.
oday, over 60% of companies are inclined toward customer choices, making them an advocate of customer segmentation and platforms (or tools) like Google Analytics, Customer.io, etc.

Luxury car manufacturers like Rolls Royce often use lifestyle-centric segmentation analysis to segment their top customers. Clearly, a data analyst familiar with customer segmentation would be a great asset to such businesses.
